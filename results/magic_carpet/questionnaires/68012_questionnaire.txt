symbol1: correct
symbol2: correct
Difficulty: average

Simply always followed one mountain first f.e. the blue one and tried one symbol. If it was correct I tried to stay on it. As soon as no more gin appeared I selected on the same mountain the other gin. If it didn't work I switched mountains. When it was windy and I landed on the other mountain I just took the opposite gin of which gave me the coins when I was there on the last time.
