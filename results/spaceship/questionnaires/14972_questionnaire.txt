I tried to find a qluster, but honestly each time I thouhgt I know how it works, I found out that I wasn't right. So over the time I approximatly tried out 10 different strageties. Over all I think that the were more diamonds on the black planet, than on the red. but I gave up counting, so that's just my personal opinion....
