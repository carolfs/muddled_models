At first, I realised that the left obelisk on planet Black produces a lot of those stones. So as long as that worked, I chose that one. The first time that the left one on planet Black was empty, I changed to the red planet. There is wasn't too clear to me which had more - I chose the left one more I think, but it was not consistent. Sometimes, it changed from left to right on planet Red everytime. So when planet red was empty, I changed back to planet Black and tried the left obelisk. But to be really honest, I was not sure if what I was doing made any sense.
