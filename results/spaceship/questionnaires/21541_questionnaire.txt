When a place had diamonds inside everytime, I returned to it. When it stopped having diamonds I scouted the other locations, but returned to the orgiginal good one to see if it started being good again (as the instructions said that the gamma radiation only changes slowly over time). I tried to always have an overiew over whether the left or right one on the respective planet was better.
