At the beginning all the spots had a crystal, so I  visited all the spots once. Than I thougt that there might be a rotation of places where the crystal grows and I tried to visit them alternatively keeping in mind which spots seemed to have crystals that span faster. If I was unsuccessful I decided to visit the spots where I haven't been lately. I think the crystals were more frequent on the red planet but that might be just an impression. When the meteor shower countered my strategy I usually just made a random decison hoping for the best.
