Upon finding a crystal I returned to it until the obelisk was empty (let's say red-left). I then switched to the other planet and often also took the opposite road (black-right). When there was nothing to be found there, I switched back to the original planet but to other direction (red-right). When a cloud interrupted a "lucky streak" (say on black-left) but brought me to a crystal on the other planet (red-left) I didn't go back to the planet I was on before the cloud appeared. In general, when e.g. black-left had been fruitful for a while, I did not expect it to have crystals and rather chose black-right.
